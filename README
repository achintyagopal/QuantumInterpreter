This is a simple quantum interpreter which will (eventually) contain the following features:

booleans
ints
qubits
functions
while loops
conditionals
+, -, *, /, %
!, &&, ||
include other files
hadamard, cnot, Pauli-Y (qubit operations)

Note: There are no for loops, and the syntax is C-like, however all the typecasting is contextual and the interpreter
will convert the type if needed (i.e. it will add to booleans by converting each boolean into an int).

In its current state, the program does not have any qubits. After writing a simple interpreter for classical features,
qubit features will be added.
