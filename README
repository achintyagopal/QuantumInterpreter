This is a simple quantum interpreter which will (eventually) contain the following features:

booleans
ints
functions
while loops
conditionals
+, -, *, /, %
!, &&, ||
include other files
qubits
hadamard, cnot, Pauli-Y (qubit operations)

Note: There are no for loops, and the syntax is C-like, however all the typecasting is done by assignments i.e.

int i;
i = 3;
bool b;
b = c;

In its current state, the program does not have any qubits. After writing a simple interpreter for classical features,
qubit features will be added.
